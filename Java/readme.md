# Java Apps
Codename One (also referred to as CN1) is a mobile cross platform environment project that provides full access to the underlying native OS code so it can compile Java bytecode to native OS executables (e.g. UWP) and a development environment for NetBeans and Eclipse for support for the Java language. This folder contains sample CN1 apps and games for UWP development and testing for Windows 10. (fork original source: https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne)

## Sample Apps
These sample apps show some example features developed in Java for the UWP:
- [**Camera**](/Java/Camera)
  
  A simple app that demonstrates how to invoke *Camera* and *Photos* as windows inside the app, with simple buttons and Chrome interface design.
