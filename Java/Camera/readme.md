## Camera
A simple app that demonstrates how to invoke Camera and Photos as windows inside the app, with simple buttons and Java's Chrome user interface design.

## More information

This app is in beta *1.0.1*, and still has not complete functionality, but you can test the app anyways. The SDK version of the app is **10.0.10586**.
