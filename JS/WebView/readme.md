## WebView
A simple WebView app created for showing how the WebView HTML control works in a JavaScript-coded UWP application for developing browser apps and/or web wrappers. NOTE: *This web app supports Service Workers in its WebView control.*

## More information
This sample app has a WebView that supports EdgeHTML service workers, so when there isn't internet connection, the web content shows as the last state before the loss of internet. TO-DO: *Add a Wi-Fi icon in the Title Bar to show connection status*. This app is in beta *1.0.1*, and still has not complete functionality, but you can test the app anyways. The SDK version of the app is **10.0.15063**, because of the use of Service Workers.
