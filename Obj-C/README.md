# Objective-C Apps
The Windows Bridge for iOS (also referred to as WinObjC) is a Microsoft open-source project that provides an Objective-C development environment for Visual Studio and support for iOS APIs. This folder contains sample WinObjC apps and games for UWP development and testing for Windows 10. (fork original source: https://github.com/Microsoft/winobjc-samples)

## Sample apps
These sample apps show some example features developed in Objective-C for the UWP:

- [**Calculator**](/Obj-C/Calculator)

- [**WebView**](/Obj-C/WebView)

  A simple WebView app which demonstrates the iOS uiWebView control in action for developing browser apps and/or web wrappers.

- [**BitcoinWallet**](/Obj-C/BitcoinWallet)
