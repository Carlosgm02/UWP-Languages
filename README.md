# UWP Language Samples
Universal Windows Platform apps can be created in a great variety of programming languages.
This is a beta repo: for now, only Typescript, Java, Oxygene, Obj-C, Python and Swift samples are available. The other 4 programming languages' samples will be added progressively. I will edit this readme file when the repo gets out of Beta.
